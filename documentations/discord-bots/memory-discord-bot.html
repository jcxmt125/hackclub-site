            <h2>Source code</h2>

            <p>
              <a class="extLink" href="https://github.com/jcxmt125/memory-discord-bot">Github repository</a><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Environment configuration</h2>

            <p>
                First, git clone the repo.<br>
                Although you could download the repo as a zip instead, cloning will allow faster updates later.<br>
                This bot requires additional modules: install them with <span class="srccode">pip install -r requirements.txt</span>.<br>
                It is recommended to do this in a venv.<br>
                If installing on a resource-constrained server, first run <span class="srccode">pip install torch --no-cache-dir</span>.<br>
                You may have to resolve some errors. <span class="srccode">sudo apt install libzbar0</span><br>
                See <a class="extLink" href="https://pypi.org/project/qreader/">here</a> for more information about QReader.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to install more programs not covered by Python dependancies:<br>

                    <li><span class="srccode">ImageMagick</span>: Install it, and test that you can access it either via <span class="srccode">magick</span> or <span class="srccode">convert</span>.</li>

                </ul>
                Both need to be on your PATH.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage instructions</h2>

            <p>
                Invite your bot to a server from the provided installation URL on the Discord developer portal.<br>
                Create two directories: <span class="srccode">ltmemories</span> and <span class="srccode">stmemories</span>.<br>
                Run <span class="srccode">bot.py</span>. You must keep this running for the bot to work.<br>
                On linux CLI, usage of tools such as "screen" is recommended.<br>
                <b>This bot may take a while to start up on slow servers.</b><br>
                Check that the bot appears "online".<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The default prefix is "?".<br>
                Add the following command after the prefix to execute:<br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>llmreq [message]: Straight request to the LLM backend. No configuration / additional features. Only supports text.</li>
                <li>dumpMemory: Sends your memory files to the channel.</li>
                <li>current: Checks whether you are in a conversation, and whether it is "stale".</li>
                <li>finish: Finishes the current conversation, wiping the short term memory and appending to long term memory.</li>
                <li>stmemPurge: Purges short term memory <b>without appending to long term memory</b>.</li>
                <li>deregisterAllMemory: <b>Permanently deletes all memory.</b> Use with caution.</li>
                <li>talk [message]: Do conversation with the bot, using its LLM backend. Short term memory will be automatically cleared if the conversation is "stale".</li>
                <li>transcribe [attachment(s) (optional)]: Transcribes audio files with OpenAI whisper running on Cloudflare AI.</li>
                <li>ytdlAudio [URL]: Downloads an audio file from YouTube. (uses ffmpeg)</li>
                <li>convert [attachment(s)] [target format]: uses ffmpeg or imagemagick depending on the file's MIME type, to convert to the target format.</li>
                <li>ffmpeg [attachment(s)] [target format]: same as above, force use of ffmpeg.</li>
                <li>magick [attachment(s)] [target format]: same as above, force use of imagemagick.</li>
                <li>urlscan [URL]: Scans URL with Cloudflare radar.</li>
                <li>qrscan [attachment(s) (optional)]: scans for QR codes in attached image.</li>
                <li>publish [attachment(s) (optional)]: publishes a txt file as an HTML file to the S3 bucket.</li>
                <li>qrcode [text]: generates a QR code. (uses imagemagick)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The bot can only send files up to 25mbs, without relation to your Discord Nitro status.<br>
                Exceptions are servers with higher "boost" statuses.<br>
                Files that fail to send may cause the bot to silently fail.<br>
                In case you are running this bot on a VPS provider, please mind the egress fee.<br>
                The bot is designed to minimize egress whenever possible, by converting images to webp.<br>
                However, this protection does not extend to usage of the convert command.<br>
                For extremely long text resopnses, the bot will try to fall back to .txt files.<br>
                When using some commands, the bot might take a bit to respond based on your server's speed (both network and CPU).<br>
                Use caution when using resource-intensive commands on resource-constrained servers. <b>It may cause the entire bot to crash.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                To update the bot, run <span class="srccode">git pull</span> in the directory of the bot.py file.<br>
                Updating may change dependancies. Run <span class="srccode">pip install -r requirements.txt</span> again.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy / Security</h2>

            <p>
                When AI features are used, the bot sends the text to Google's Gemini API for analysis.<br>
                On free tier, Google may use this collected data to improve its models.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                When "attachment optional" features are used without an attachment, the bot will scan some previous messages (5 by default) to find the required file.<br>
                If possible, attach the file to the command message directly.<br>
                <br>
                Nothing is logged to a file by default.<br>
                Some things are printed to the terminal.<br>
                <br>
                The bot shouldn't be able to execute any code.<br>
                However, some features will cause files to be downloaded to the server briefly while it processes.<br>
                They will be deleted as soon as feasible.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Fallbacks</h2>

            <p>
                The bot will fall back to Cloudflare AI's Llama 3.1 model in some cases when Gemini API fails.<br>
                This may be due to a rate limit, or because something else happened.<br>
                You may notice degraded response performance (both speed and quality) when this happens.<br>
            </p>
