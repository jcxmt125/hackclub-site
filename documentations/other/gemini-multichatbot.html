            <h2>Environment configuration</h2>

            <p>
                First, git clone the repo.<br>
                Although you could download the repo as a zip instead, cloning will allow faster updates later.<br>
                This project requires additional modules: install them with "pip install -r requirements.txt".<br>
                It is recommended to do this in a venv.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                This project requires a .env file:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_KEY: an API key with access to Cloudflare's Workers AI.</li>
                    <li>CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_SLUG: the slug you set for Cloudflare's AI gateway.</li>

                    <li>CLOUDFLARE_RADAR_API_KEY: an API key with access to Cloudflare radar.</li>

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to install more programs not covered by Python dependancies:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>ImageMagick: Install it, and test that you can access it either via "magick" or "convert".</li>
                    <li>ffmpeg: Install it, and test you can access it on the cli.</li>
                </ul>
                Both need to be on your PATH.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage instructions</h2>

            <p>
                Run main.py, and follow setup instructions.<br>
                This will create a config.json file in the directory.<br>
                This file will store some options, including the bot's "personality", and its memory about you.<br>
                This file is mostly human readable. You may modify the settings, but be careful.<br>
                (An integrated edit settings feature will be implemented later!)<br>
                A temp directory will also be created. Any files here may be deleted.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                To chat, simply enter your prompt and hit return.<br>
                A file attachment message will be written to terminal.<br>
                Press return again to ignore, or drag and drop a file.<br>
                Due to some issues, the bot might be unable to process directories with spaces or non-english characters.<br>
                Please move and rename your files to a simpler directory and try again in case of an error!<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                To use tools, type + followed by a message.<br>
                For example, +Help me convert a video.<br>
                The bot will launch the appropriate tool when possible.<br>
                The bot can use the following tools:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>ffmpeg*: video/audio conversion</li>
                    <li>imagemagick*: image conversion</li>
                    <li>qreader: QR code scanning</li>
                    <li>pyqrcode: QR code generation</li>
                    <li>stable diffusion: (running on CF AI as SDXL) image generation</li>
                    <li>Whisper: (local or on CF AI, depending on your setup) audio transcription</li>
                </ul>
                Tools marked with an asterisk use CLI tools on your behalf.<br>
                Make sure they're installed!
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some slash commands you can use. Type /h for help.<br>
                /c will clear the short term memory, and save a summary of the current conversation into your long term memory.<br>
                /e will do the same, but exit the script entirely.<br>
                /f will force clear short term memory, removing it without a summary.<br>
                The script only reads the first character.
            </p>

            <p>
                To update the project, run git pull in the directory of the main.py file.<br>
                Updating may change dependancies. Run pip install -r requirements.txt again.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy / Security</h2>

            <p>
                Your conversations will be sent to the Gemini API.<br>
                On free tier, Google may use this to improve their models.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversation summaries are logged to a file in plaintext JSON by default, to help it remember you.<br>
                <br>
                Some features may run CLI tools on your behalf.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Fallbacks</h2>

            <p>
                Some features may fall back to Cloudflare AI's Llama3 model.<br>
                Only classification tasks are done this way.<br>
            </p>
