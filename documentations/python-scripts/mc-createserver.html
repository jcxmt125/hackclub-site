            <h1>Documentation for mc-createserver.py</h1>

            <h2>Source code</h2>

            <p>
              <a class="extLink" href="https://github.com/jcxmt125/side-projects/blob/main/python%20scripts/mc-serverdeploy.py">Main python script</a><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Environment configuration</h2>

            <p>
              This script does not require additional modules.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              This script does not require a .env file.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Deploying to a server</h2>

            <p>
              This program will install a minecraft server to a linux server.<br>
              First, move the python file to the directory you'd like to install to.<br>
              Execute the Python file. It'll ask you some questions.<br>
              Follow the instructions, and a minecraft server will be installed on your current directory.<br>
              Note the command displayed on screen, as it'll allow you to run the server.<br>
              You may delete the Python script, as it isn't needed anymore.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>More involved instructions: Deploying to Oracle Free tier</h2>

            <p>
              Guide based on <a class="extLink" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/how-to-set-up-and-run-a-really-powerful-free-minecraft-server-in-the-cloud">this</a> official blogpost by Oracle.<br>
              Quick note: I'm using Oracle since they have the most generous free tier.<br>
              This may change at any time.<br>
              I'm not responsible for any economical damages that occur due to following this guide.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Sign up to OCS</h3>

            <p>
              Head to the <a class="extLink" href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/">free tier explanation website</a> and read though <i>carefully</i>.<br>
              Make sure you understand what's free and what isn't.<br>
              We're looking for "Arm compute instance" of the Always free category.<br>
              Click "start for free", and begin signing up.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              You'll need to provide personal information.<br>
              <b>Read through the terms you agree to carefully.</b><br>
              <b>Read through all appropriate warnings. Pay special attention to warnings related to A1 compute instances, as they are what we will be using.</b><br>
              When the author was signing up, there were availability warnings for instances on the Seoul region.<br>
              Make sure to use your own judgement when choosing your home region.<br>
              As the warning states, it cannot be changed later.<br>
              Make sure you provide accurate information, as not doing so can and likely will result in legal headaches later.<br>
              As previously stated, this guide is provided <b>as-is</b>, without any warranties.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Payment information will be required.<br>
              There will be a temporary charge.<br>
              Make sure you use an internationally accepted card (Visa, Mastercard or AMEX) with international purchaces enabled.<br>
              Click "start my free trial" to finish up.<br>
              Wait for a few moments as the account is set up.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Sign into your created account.<br>
              Note: your password manager may not haved saved your details correctly.<br>
              Head into the list and retrieve your password, then sign in once manually.<br>
              Setting up Passkeys, Mobile app auth, or another 2fa method is highly recommended.<br>
            </p>


            <h3>Deploying an A1 instance</h3>

            <p>
              Log into your account, and head to the "get started" tab. You should be there by default.<br>
              Scroll down to "launch resources", and click "create a VM instance".<br>
              Things should be set to an appropriate setting by default.<br>
              If not mentioned in this guide, you shouldn't need to touch it.<br>
              You may experiment, of course!
            </p>

            <p>
              Scroll down to find "image and shape".<br>
              Select "edit" to expand the section and start editing.<br>
              Select "change shape".<br>
              Select "Ampere".<br>
              Check the box next to "VM.Standard.A1.Flex".<br>
              Select the CPUs and RAM capacity as you please. You can get up to 4 OCPUs and 24 GBs of RAM for free..<br>
              Don't worry, you can modify this later!<br>
              Click "select shape" to save and dismiss.<br>
              Make sure it says "Always Free-eligible".
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, we'll have to set up SSH.<br>
              Already know how it works? Upload your key files.<br>
              Else, leave it as is, and <b>download both key files.</b><br>
              <b>The private key, especially, will not be shown later.</b><br>
              You <i>cannot</i> access the VM without this.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              You should be able to leave storage defaults.<br>
              Click create, and Oracle will create a VM for you.<br>
              If it errors out, try modifying your availability domain.<br>
              If even that doesn't work, you'll have to wait a bit.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Preparing and deploying the minecraft server</h3>

            <p>
              Have a server now? Great! We'll have to connect via SSH.<br>
              You'll want to take note of the "Public IPv4 address".<br>
              Type ssh opc@[IP address] -i [path to the downloaded private key file] into your terminal.<br>
              Type "yes" to trust the key.<br>
              You should be connected, and be ready to run commands now.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Side note - you'll need to set permissions.<br>
              On Windows:<br>
              If you get an error with the SSH key, right click to open properties, and head to the security tab.<br>
              Click advanced.<br>
              In the window that opens, click "Don't use inheritance" or similar.<br>
              Delete "Authenticated users" and "Users", then add yourself.<br>
              Save and exit.<br>
            </p>


            <p>
              Let's download the assistant script.<br>
              First, cd into your desired directory.<br>
              Paste and run the following command into your terminal:<br>
              curl -OJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcxmt125/side-projects/main/python%20scripts/mc-serverdeploy.py<br>
              We'll now have to install Java.<br>
              Run yum list jdk* on the server. (This may take a bit!)<br>
              Read the output, and install the latest JDK. It should look something like this:<br>
              jdk-[version-number]-... (You may go ahead and choose headless if it presents the option.)<br>
              Run sudo yum install [name of package].<br>
              If it asks if this is okay, say y(es).<br>
              You may run the Python script now.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              You should be ready to run the server.<br>
              Note the command the script gave you, and come back to your desktop.<br>
              Don't exit the SSH session just yet.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Network setup</h3>

            <p>
              Now it's time to make your server actually connectable.<br>
              On the dashboard of your running cloud server, click the subnet link.<br>
              By default, it should look like subnet-[date]-[time].<br>
              Click on "Default Security list for..."<br>
              Click the "Add ingress rules" button.<br>
              Set Source CIDR to 0.0.0.0/0, and Destination Port range to 25565.<br>
              Click "Add ingress rules".<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Go back to the SSH session.<br>
              Run these commands in your terminal:<br>
              sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=25565/tcp<br>
              sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=25565/udp<br>
              sudo firewall-cmd --reload<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              You can optionally connect your server to a domain.<br>
              Add an A record for the public IP address.<br>
              If you're using Cloudflare: Make sure you turn proxying off.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Start and connect to the server</h3>

            <p>
              Run the provided command.<br>
              It is recommended to do this in, for example, a "screen" or tmux, so as not to lose your connection.<br>
              Your server should start up!<br>
              In your Minecraft client, add the server.<br>
              In multiplayer, "add server".<br>
              Input the IP address, or your configured domain.<br>
              You should be able to connect now!
            </p>

            <h3>Stopping the server</h3>

            <p>
              You shouldn't need to stop the server, but if you need to for some reason, type stop and return.<br>
              You can configure it as you like, but this script can't help with that.
