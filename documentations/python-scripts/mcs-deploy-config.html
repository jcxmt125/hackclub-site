            </p>

            <h2>Preparing your config file</h2>

            <p>
              This program will help you install a minecraft server to a linux server.<br>
              First, we'll create the config file.<br>
              Execute the Full config generation script (mcs-make-config) file on your desktop machine.<br>
              Answer the questions to get a json config file.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Deploying the server</h2>

            <p>
              We'll want to download the necessary files to your server.<br>
              First, cd into the directory you want your server installed to.<br>
              Download the server script with the following command:<br>
              curl -OJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcxmt125/side-projects/main/python%20scripts/mcs-deploy-config/mcs-deploy-config.py<br>
              Then transfer your config file with scp or similar.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Execute the script on your server. It won't need additional modules.<br>
              Follow the instructions, and a minecraft server will be installed on your current directory.<br>
              Note the command displayed on screen, as it'll allow you to run the server.<br>
              As instructed, you may also use ./start.sh instead.<br>
              You may delete the Python script, as it isn't needed anymore.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Specifically, deploying to Oracle Free tier</h2>

            <p>
              For deploying entirely from scratch (without a set up Oracle account or server), see <a style="color: #b6defa;" href="mc-createserver.html">here</a>.<br>
              For following this guide, just connect to SSH, then download the above script.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Preparing and deploying the minecraft server</h3>

            <p>
              After downloading the main script, execute the following command:<br>
              curl -OJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcxmt125/side-projects/main/python%20scripts/mcs-deploy-config/mcs-oraclefree-wrapper.py<br>
              Don't forget to also transfer your config file.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Execute the "wrapper" Python script.<br>
              On the output, copy the latest headless version of Java.<br>
              For me, it looked like "jdk-22-headless.aarch64".<br>
              Paste it in, and when prompted, type "y" then return to allow yum to install Java.<br>
              Input the name of your config file, and press return.<br>
              When prompted, return to launch nano and agree to EULA.<br>
              Wait a few moments, and your server will be ready to go!<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Come back to your desktop.<br>
              Don't exit the SSH session just yet, the server isn't running yet!<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Network setup</h3>

            <p>
              Now it's time to make your server actually connectable.<br>
              On the dashboard of your running cloud server, click the subnet link.<br>
              By default, it should look like subnet-[date]-[time].<br>
              Click on "Default Security list for..."<br>
              Click the "Add ingress rules" button.<br>
              Set Source CIDR to 0.0.0.0/0, and Destination Port range to 25565.<br>
              Click "Add ingress rules".<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              You can optionally connect your server to a domain.<br>
              Add an A record for the public IP address.<br>
              If you're using Cloudflare: Make sure you turn proxying off.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Start and connect to the server</h3>

            <p>
              Run the provided command.<br>
              Either paste it in directly, or do source start.sh<br>
              It is recommended to do this in, for example, a "screen" or tmux, so as not to lose your connection.<br>
              Your server should start up!<br>
              In your Minecraft client, add the server.<br>
              In multiplayer, "add server".<br>
              Input the IP address, or your configured domain.<br>
              You should be able to connect now!
            </p>

            <h3>Stopping the server</h3>

            <p>
              You shouldn't need to stop the server, but if you need to for some reason, type stop and return.<br>
              You can configure it as you like, but this script can't help with that.
            </p>
