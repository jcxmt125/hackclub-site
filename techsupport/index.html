            <h2>Which platform do you need help with?</h2>

            <p>
              <a class="intLink" href="windows-help/index.html">Windows 10/11</a><br>
              <a class="intLink" href="android-help/index.html">Android</a><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Not sure what platform you're using?</h3>

            <p>
              If you're using a computer, and you aren't using a device from Apple, you're likely on Windows.<br>
              <a class="extLink" href="ms-settings:">Try pressing this.</a> If your browser asks whether to allow this site to open settings, you're on Windows.<br>
              Dismiss the window (press cancel) and head to the appropriate place above.<br>
              If it doesn't work and you're on a computer, you may be using Mac OS or an outdated version of Windows.<br>
              In this case, this website cannot help, and you should ask someone knowledgable about this topic instead.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              If you're using a phone, and it's not an iPhone, you're likely on Android.<br>
              Not sure? Turn your phone over to the back. If you see a logo of an apple, you're on an Apple device.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't own an Apple device, so tutorials aren't available.
